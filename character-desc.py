#Fire Wizard

fire_wizard_desc = """
Archmage [Fire Wizard Name], had always been the Master of Flame Magic. Wielding the power of fire to bring enemies into the curse of intense heat, may they be lost to all but ashes, or to be devoured by the monsters of their sin.
With a flick of the wrist, the Fire Wizard can conjure blazing fireballs, create walls of flame, and summon fiery storms that engulf the battlefield. Their mastery over fire allows them to incinerate foes, melt obstacles, and light the darkest of paths.
Clad in robes of ember and ash, the kingdom sees the Fire Wizard as a beacon of destruction and renewal, a force that can both annihilate and in a sense, purify. A testament to their fiery prowess."""

With the combined efforts of Archmage [Fire Wizard Name] and the kingdom's master blacksmith, the Fire Knight wore a suit of enchanted armor forged with the scales 
of the dragons that once terrorized the land. And with the fiery sword blazing with the power of the fire imbued from the archmage's hands, 
the Fire Knight became an unstoppable force on the battlefield, striking doom upon the lands, piercing upon the honor of his kingdom's enemies."""
