To implement the skill rects and their associated functions and features in your main code, we will take inspiration from your s code but revise it to be modular, reusable, and easier to manage. I'll break this down into steps to ensure clarity and alignment with your current main structure.

Step 1: Define Skill Rects in a Modular Way
In your s code, skill rects like skill_1_rect, skill_2_rect, etc., are defined individually. This approach works but is not scalable or reusable. Instead, we can define a SkillManager class to handle all skill-related rects and their properties.

Revised Code for Skill Rects
Create a SkillManager class in your main code to manage skill rects and their properties:



Step 2: Define Skill Data
In your main code, define the skill data for each player. This will include the image paths and mana costs for each skill.

Step 3: Initialize Skill Managers
In your main code, initialize the SkillManager for each player. This will create and manage the skill rects for both players.




Step 4: Draw Skills in the Game Loop
In your gameloop code, draw the skill icons for both players using the SkillManager.

Step 5: Handle Skill Features
You can now extend the SkillManager class or the Player class to handle additional features, such as:

Mana Cost Validation:
Check if the player has enough mana to use a skill before allowing it to be activated.
Cooldowns:
Add a cooldown timer for each skill to prevent spamming.
Skill Effects:
Trigger specific effects (e.g., animations, damage) when a skill is used.
Example: Adding Mana Cost Validation
Modify the is_skill_clicked method to check if the player has enough mana:


Step 6: Add Cooldowns
You can add a cooldown timer for each skill by extending the SkillManager class. For example:


Summary
Skill Rects:
Use the SkillManager class to manage skill rects, images, mana costs, and cooldowns.
Modular Design:
Define skill data in a structured way and initialize SkillManager for each player.
Game Loop Integration:
Draw skills and handle skill clicks in the game loop.
Extend Features:
Add mana cost validation, cooldowns, and skill effects as needed.
This approach is modular, reusable, and aligns with the structure of your main code. Let me know if you need further clarification or help with implementation!
